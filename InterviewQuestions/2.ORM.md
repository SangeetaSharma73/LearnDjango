# ORM in Django

## What is ORM?

**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is a technique that allows you to interact with your database using the object-oriented paradigm of your programming language instead of writing raw SQL queries. Essentially, it maps database tables to classes and rows to objects of those classes.

### General Explanation
- **Object-Oriented**: You work with objects and classes instead of rows and tables.
- **Mapping**: The ORM maps classes to database tables and class attributes to table columns.

## What is ORM in Django?

In Django, the ORM is a powerful feature that allows developers to interact with the database using Python code. It handles the conversion between database tables and Python objects seamlessly, making database operations easier and more intuitive.

### Key Properties/Features of Django's ORM

1. **Model Definition**:
    - You define your database schema using Python classes, known as models.
    - Example:
    ```python
    from django.db import models

    class Author(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        birthdate = models.DateField()
    ```

2. **Querying**:
    - Django ORM provides a high-level API to query the database in a Pythonic way.
    - Example:
    ```python
    # Get all authors
    authors = Author.objects.all()

    # Get a specific author by name
    author = Author.objects.get(name="J.K. Rowling")
    ```

3. **Relationships**:
    - Django ORM supports defining relationships between models (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
    - Example:
    ```python
    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ```

4. **Migrations**:
    - Django ORM supports database migrations, which allows you to apply changes to your database schema over time.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Validation**:
    - Django ORM includes built-in validation for model fields, ensuring data integrity.
    - Example:
    ```python
    from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

    def validate_name(value):
        if not value.isalpha():
            raise ValidationError('Name must contain only letters')

    class Author(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100, validators=[validate_name])
        birthdate = models.DateField()
    ```

### Example of Using Django ORM

Let's put it all together with a practical example:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    birthdate = models.DateField()

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Creating an author
author = Author(name="J.K. Rowling", birthdate="1965-07-31")
author.save()

# Creating a book
book = Book(title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", author=author)
book.save()

# Querying the database
all_books = Book.objects.all()
print(all_books)

# Filtering books by author
jk_rowling_books = Book.objects.filter(author__name="J.K. Rowling")
print(jk_rowling_books)
```

That's it! The Django ORM is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your database using Python code, making development faster and easier. ðŸš€
