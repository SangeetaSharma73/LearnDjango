# API

- Imagine you have a toy box full of different toys. Now, let's say you want to play with a robot toy, but you don't know how to turn it on. You see a button on the robot that says "Press to Start." When you press that button, the robot starts moving and playing with you. That button is like a way to communicate with the robot and tell it what you want it to do.

- In the same way, an API (which stands for Application Programming Interface) is like a button or a set of instructions that allows different software programs to talk to each other and do things. For example, if you have a game on your tablet and you want to share your high score with your friends on a social media app, the game can use an API to send that information to the social media app.

- So, an API is just a way for different programs to talk to each other and share information, just like pressing a button on a toy to make it do something.

# What is an API?

Hello! üëã Let's learn about APIs in a simple way. Imagine APIs like a waiter in a restaurant:

üîπ What is an API?
API (Application Programming Interface) is like a messenger that helps two different software systems talk to each other.

Imagine an API as a waiter in a restaurant:

You (the user) order food (request).
The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server).
The kitchen prepares the food (processes the request).
The waiter brings the food back to you (response).

## The Restaurant Example üçΩÔ∏è

1. **Restaurant**: This is like a computer or an app.
2. **Menu**: This is like the list of things the app can do.
3. **Waiter**: This is like the API.

### How It Works:

1. **You (Customer)**: You want to order food.
2. **Waiter (API)**: You tell the waiter what you want from the menu.
3. **Kitchen (App)**: The waiter tells the kitchen to make your food.
4. **Waiter (API)**: The waiter brings the food back to you.

So, an **API (Application Programming Interface)** is like the waiter. It takes your request, tells the app what you want, and brings back the result.

## Why Do We Need APIs?

- **Communication**: APIs help different apps talk to each other.
- **Efficiency**: They make it easier to get data or perform actions.
- **Integration**: You can use parts of other apps without building everything from scratch.

## Example:

Imagine you are playing a game and you want to see your friend's high score. The game will use an API to ask the server for your friend's score and show it to you.

That's it! APIs are like helpful waiters in the world of computers and apps. üçîüíª


# Types of APIs and Their Properties

Hello again! Now that you know what an API is, let's learn about the different types of APIs and their properties.

## Types of APIs

1. **Open APIs (Public APIs)**:
    - **Description**: These are available to the public and can be used by anyone.
    - **Properties**:
        - **Accessibility**: Open to everyone.
        - **Usage**: Often free, but may have usage limits.
        - **Examples**: Weather APIs, Google Maps API.

2. **Partner APIs**:
    - **Description**: These are shared with specific partners or collaborators.
    - **Properties**:
        - **Accessibility**: Only available to certain users or partners.
        - **Usage**: Often used for business collaborations.
        - **Examples**: APIs shared between businesses for better integration.

3. **Internal APIs (Private APIs)**:
    - **Description**: These are used within an organization.
    - **Properties**:
        - **Accessibility**: Only available within the organization.
        - **Usage**: Helps different parts of a company to work together.
        - **Examples**: APIs used to connect internal systems like HR and finance.

4. **Composite APIs**:
    - **Description**: These combine multiple APIs into one.
    - **Properties**:
        - **Accessibility**: Can be open, partner, or internal.
        - **Usage**: Make it easier to perform complex tasks with one call.
        - **Examples**: APIs that combine weather, location, and map services.

## Properties of APIs

1. **Endpoints**:
    - **Description**: The URL where the API can be accessed.
    - **Example**: `https://api.example.com/data`

2. **Methods**:
    - **Description**: The actions you can perform with the API.
    - **Types**: 
        - **GET**: Retrieve data.
        - **POST**: Send data.
        - **PUT**: Update data.
        - **DELETE**: Remove data.

3. **Authentication**:
    - **Description**: How the API verifies who you are.
    - **Types**: 
        - **API Keys**: A unique key you use to access the API.
        - **OAuth**: A way to access the API using your Google, Facebook, or other accounts.

4. **Rate Limits**:
    - **Description**: Limits on how many times you can use the API in a certain period.
    - **Example**: 1000 requests per hour.

5. **Response Format**:
    - **Description**: The format in which the API returns data.
    - **Types**: 
        - **JSON**: A common, easy-to-read format.
        - **XML**: Another format, often used in older systems.

6. **Documentation**:
    - **Description**: Guides and information on how to use the API.
    - **Importance**: Good documentation helps users understand and use the API effectively.

That's it! These are the main types of APIs and their properties. APIs can be very powerful tools for connecting different apps and services. üöÄ

# REST API and FastAPI

Let's learn about REST API and FastAPI, as well as their key properties.

## What is REST API?

### Definition
A **REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)** is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet using HTTP requests. It's a set of rules that developers follow when creating APIs.

### Key Principles and Properties
1. **Stateless**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
2. **Client-Server**: The client and server are separate and communicate via requests and responses.
3. **Uniform Interface**: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and has a predictable structure.
4. **Cacheable**: Responses from the server can be cached by the client to improve performance.
5. **Layered System**: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer interacting only with the layer directly adjacent to it.

### Example
A simple REST API endpoint to get user data:
```
GET /users/{userId}
```

## What is FastAPI?

### Definition
**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and understand, and to provide high performance.

### Key Features and Properties
1. **Speed**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, thanks to its use of asynchronous programming.
2. **Ease of Use**: It is designed to be easy to use and learn, with automatic interactive API documentation.
3. **Type Hints**: Utilizes Python type hints to provide better developer experience and data validation.
4. **Automatic Documentation**: Generates interactive documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.
5. **Dependency Injection**: Supports dependency injection, making it easy to manage and inject dependencies into your API endpoints.

### Example
A simple FastAPI endpoint to get user data:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def read_user(user_id: int):
    return {"user_id": user_id}
```

## Comparing REST API and FastAPI

### Differences
1. **Performance**: FastAPI is generally faster due to its asynchronous nature.
2. **Ease of Use**: FastAPI provides automatic documentation and type hints, making it easier for developers.
3. **Implementation**: REST API is a concept and can be implemented using various frameworks, while FastAPI is a specific framework.

### Similarities
1. **HTTP Methods**: Both use standard HTTP methods for communication.
2. **Stateless**: Both follow the stateless principle.
3. **Client-Server**: Both follow the client-server architecture.

## Use Cases

### REST API
- Suitable for applications where the client and server interactions are well-defined and predictable.
- Commonly used in web services and microservices.

### FastAPI
- Ideal for applications requiring high performance and concurrency.
- Suitable for modern web applications and APIs that benefit from automatic documentation and type validation.

That's it! Now you have a good understanding of what REST API and FastAPI are, along with their properties and differences. üöÄ
