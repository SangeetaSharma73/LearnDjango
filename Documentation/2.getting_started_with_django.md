# Getting Started with Django

## Creating a Django Project
To start a new Django project, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Ensure that Django is installed in your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

2. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```

## Understanding Django Project Structure
When you create a Django project, it generates a specific structure that includes several important files and directories:

### Typical Project Structure:
```
myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
```

### Explanation:
- **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project (e.g., running the server, creating apps).
- **settings.py**: Contains all configuration settings for the project.
- **urls.py**: Handles URL routing, mapping URLs to views.
- **wsgi.py** and **asgi.py**: Interfaces for deploying your project in different server environments.

## Running the Development Server
To run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser to see the default welcome page.

## Creating and Running Django Apps
Django projects are made up of individual apps. You can create an app using:
```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

### App Structure:
```
myapp/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
```

### Explanation:
- **models.py**: Contains model definitions, which represent the data structure.
- **views.py**: Contains the logic for processing requests and returning responses.
- **admin.py**: Used to register models with the Django admin.
- **migrations/**: Tracks changes to the database schema.

## Djangoâ€™s MVT (Model-View-Template) Pattern
Django follows the **MVT** pattern, which helps separate concerns:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic (interacts with the database).
- **View**: Handles the request/response logic (processing data and returning a response).
- **Template**: Handles the presentation layer (HTML files that display data).

**Example Flow**:
1. The user requests a URL.
2. The URL dispatcher maps the request to a view.
3. The view processes data (possibly querying models).
4. The view renders a template and sends the final HTML response to the user.

## Example of Creating a Simple View
Create a view in `views.py`:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

Add the view to `urls.py`:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import hello_world

urlpatterns = [
    path('', hello_world),
]
```

Run the server and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see "Hello, world!"
